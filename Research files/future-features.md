# Future Features

### Business Logic

#### MODES

- 23/9/2023
  - Noticing that as as a user constinues to follow multiple accounts, the `following` section of the wems would easily become a cluster of many different ideas, creating a similar unpuposeful / aimless scrolling which is commonly found i other social media.
    To curb this, an idea for bridge is to implement a `mode` feature. This feature would be similar to playlist in musical apps, where the user himself (not an algorithm) organizes the accounts he follows into `modes` e.g space mode, productivity mode, technology mode, musical mode etc. These modes would serve as a subdomains for the accounts a user follows, creating structure and encouraging purposeful usage (scrolling).

### Frontend

### Backend

#### Global error handling

I must still create a global error handler for when the process is in production
