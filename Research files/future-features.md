# Future Features

### Business Logic

#### TEMPLATE OR INSTANCE PAGE / CHAT

#### MODES (might also be called PlayList or ViewLists)

- 23/9/2023
  - Noticing that as as a user constinues to follow multiple accounts, the `following` section of the wems would easily become a cluster of many different ideas, creating a similar unpuposeful / aimless scrolling which is commonly found i other social media.
    To curb this, an idea for bridge is to implement a `mode` feature. This feature would be similar to playlist in musical apps, where the user himself (not an algorithm) organizes the accounts he follows into `modes` e.g space mode, productivity mode, technology mode, musical mode etc. These modes would serve as a subdomains for the accounts a user follows, creating structure and encouraging purposeful usage (scrolling).

#### PRIVACY SETTINGS, DATA MANAGEMENT AND TERMS AND CONDITIOINS.

- 26/9/2023
  - There are some kinda important data management rules that wembee would have to follow. Most of them are unknown to me now, but some exaples that I might consider are: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).
    These should be final included in final touches I would make when the final version of Wembee is a finished product.
    I can also check the existing terms and conditions on othe social sites and try to adapt from theirs.

#### GLOBAL VARIABLES

- 26/9/2023
  - Global variables are a feature that would grant users the ability to store data which they can easily re-use through the app or in a chat environment. They are the predessecors for more intimate variable features like AI memes that are generate using images a user stores and made accessible to it's usable scope.

### Frontend

### Backend

#### Global error handling

I must still create a global error handler for when the process is in production
